A dialogue with myself.

I made this website using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie with Hugo theme Fuji and deployed by Netlify.

I largely use the blogdown workflow [recommended here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/workflow.html). 

1. Serve Site on first open of RStudio
2. Addins -> New Post
3. Commit to Github 
4. Voila! Check website to make sure it has been refreshed
